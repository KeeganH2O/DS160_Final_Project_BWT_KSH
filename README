  The data used for this analysis project is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Library for use in learning amateur machine learning techniques. 
The data represent Polish companies over a forecasting period that included various measures of economic success to determine whether a specific 
company is bankrupt or not. After using data manipulation techniques, we combined the 5 data sets included in this repository into a large data 
frame for use with a variety of machine learning algorithms. To deal with missing data, we replaced any missing data with the mean of its corresponding 
column. In this analysis, we used logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest algorithms to create a model to predict the economic 
futures of these companies. Our analysis yielded results that showed that a decision tree was the best method of prediction out of the three models
we used with an overall accuracy of 96%.
